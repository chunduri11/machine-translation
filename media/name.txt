Parasurama heard him unmoved
without so much as looking at him, and
addressed himself solely to Rama, as
though the others did not exist:
"Viswakarma originally made two exactly
similar bows. One of them was given to
Rudra and the other to Vishnu. This is the
one given to Vishnu. What you are said to
have strung and bent to the breaking point
was Siva's bow. See if you can, string this
bow of Vishnu; and if you do, it will be
proof of your skill and strength and I will
then honor you by fighting with you."
Parasurama spoke in a loud and
arrogant tone. To him Rama replied in
courteous manner, yet in firm tones: "Son
of Jamadagni! You have been vengeful
because your father was killed by a king. I
do not blame you for that. But you cannot
put me down as you have humbled others.
Please give me your bow."
